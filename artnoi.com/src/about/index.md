# A bit about your host
Hello, world! I'm Prem Phansuriyanon, a finance student turned self-taught programmer. I first learned Go and TypeScript, and now I'm learning Rust. I'm an aspiring system programmer, because I like to write code and [setting up my computers](os.html).

## Software development
### Personal projects
I'm the author of the following Go software

- file encryption utility [gfc](https://github.com/artnoi43/gfc)

- financial market bot [fngobot](https://github.com/artnoi43/fngobot)

- DoH/DoT stub resolver [stubborn](https://github.com/artnoi43/stubborn)

and countless other useless programs on [github.com/artnoi43](https://github.com/artnoi43)

### Work
I write Go Web3 service back-end code for my company. As a result, I have quite grown familiar with CI/CD, DevOps (GitOps), container technologies, and cloud service providers, especially GCP and AWS.
