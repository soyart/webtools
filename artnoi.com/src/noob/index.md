## UNIX manual pages (`man(1)` pages)
It is best to first read the manual with `man(1)`. See also: [usage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page#Command_usage).
#### Arch Linux `man(1)` pages
Arch Linux's `base` metapackage by default does not ship with `man(1)`, although the package manual pages are already packaged and installed on the system by `pacman`.

To use `man(1)`, install `man-db` packages:

    # pacman -S man-db;
	$ man ls; # see manual pages for ls(1)

## Users and groups
### Changing one's own password

    $ passwd <username>;

You can put your own `username` or you can just omit it.

### Changing other user's password

    # passwd <username>;

### Switching user (with new user's password)

    $ su <username>;

`su` defaults to root user and will ask for the root password, i.e. if `<username>` is not specified.

### Switching to root using `sudo(8)` (using `sudo` requires the admin user's password, not root password)

    $ sudo -i;

## Files and permissions
### Using `ls(1)` to print a 'long' (detailed) output

    $ ls -l;

### Changing permissions (or 'modes') with `chmod(1)`

    # chown <owner>:<group> <path>;

### Changing file permissions

    # chmod <mode> <path>;

> Hint: Use `-R` option to use `chmod(1)` or `chown(1)` recursively: `# chown -R artnoi:artnoi /home/artnoi/Downloads`

Note that the modes can be either

1.  [Numerical](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/unix-linux-bsd-chmod-numeric-permissions-notation-command) which can be [calculated](https://chmod-calculator.com) or memorized easily (e.g. `600` for private files, `755` for normal files)  
2.  `drwxrwxrwx` = directory(`d`) + user(`rwx`) + group(`rwx`) + others(`rwx`)

### Examples: changing file permission with `chmod(1)`

Adding *execute* permission to file `foo`

    # chmod +x foo;

Removing *write* permission to file `foo`

    # chmod -w foo;

Adding *write* permission to all files in directory `bar`

    # chmod -R +w bar;

Adding *read and wite* permission to all files in directory `bar` **for owner's 'group' members**

    # chmod -R g+rw bar;

Removing *write, read, and execute* permission to all files in directory `bar` **for 'others' (world)**

    # chmod -R o-rwx bar;

## Arch Linux package management

> See also: [manual for `pacman(8)`](https://man.archlinux.org/man/pacman.8)

Arch Linux official package manager is `pacman(8)`. The program has a few majors operations, namely `-S` (`--sync`) for syncing from the repos, `-Q` for querying the local database, `-R` (`--remove`) for removing packages, and `-D` (`--database`) for database operation. These major operations, when used in shortened forms, are in uppercase.
### Searching and querying package info
#### Searching for packages using regexp (`-s`, or `--search`)
Search option will use the [regular expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) to search for packages. `-S` means that `pacman` will search on the repos, while `-Q` will make it search the local database.

    $ pacman -Ss tmux;	# search mirrors
	$ pacman -Qs tmux;	# search local db

#### Getting package information (`-i`, or `--info`)
Note that `-i` option will use **exact match** (not regexp) to find the package information.

	$ pacman -Si tmux;
	$ pacman -Qi tmux;

#### Listing all files from packages

	$ pacman -Ql tmux;

### Completely removing a package

    # pacman -Rns <package>;

### Syncing package database and upgrade

    # pacman -Syyu;

(Note the double 'y') This may be done after switching repos, i.e. from Thai servers to Korean ones.

### Configuring `pacman.conf(5)`
`pacman`'s main configuration file is stored in `/etc/pacman.conf`, with additional configuration files in `/etc/pacman.d` directory. One file that we may want to edit a little bit often is `/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist` which stores information about repo servers.

### Getting block device information
The commands below can be used to view block device information. `blkid` needs root privilege though.

    $ lsblk <device>;
    $ lsblk -f <device>;
    # blkid <device>;

Note that if you specify `<device>`, `lsblk(8)` and `blkid(8)` will only display information related to the specified device. In other words, omit `<device>` to get information from all block devices. Another note is that block devices can be both:

1.  Normal block devices - which can be found in `/dev/`, and usually in *sda, sdb2, vda, vdb1, mmcblk0, mmcblk0p3* formats  
2.  Device mapper - which can be found in `/dev/mapper`  

### Editting normal block device partitions

    # fdisk <device>;
    # cfdisk <device>;

For logical volume, please see `lvm(8)` man pages.

### Mounting/unmounting filesystem

    # mount <device> <mountpoint>;
    # umount <device>;
    # umount <mountpoint>;

### Creating (formatting) LUKS device

    # cryptsetup luksFormat <device>;

### Openning (unlocking) LUKS device

    # cryptsetup luksOpen <device> <name>;
    # cryptsetup luksOpen <device> <name> --key-file <path>;

Now, your dm-crypt device should be available at `/dev/mapper/<name>`

### Creating filesystem with mkfs(8)
A coresponding `mkfs`.*type* utility is used to create a filesystem on Linux.

**EXT4**

	# mkfs.ext4 <device>;

**EXT4 with no journal (lighter on systems)**

	# mkfs.ext4 -O "^has_journal" <device>;

**FAT32 (using FAT)**

	# mkfs.fat -F32 <device>;

**FAT32 (using VFAT)**

	# mkfs.vfat -F32 <device>;

Example - Creating and mounting a LUKS-encrypted EXT4 filesystem on partition `/dev/vda3`:

	# cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/vda3;
	# cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/vda3 foo;
	# mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/foo;
	# mount /dev/mapper/foo /mnt;

### EXT4 defrag (HDD)
Use `e4defrag(8)` to defrag an *EXT4 filesystem on a hard disk drive* on-line. Note that You need root privileges to defrag system files

### Disk tuning
#### SSD TRIM
`fstrim(8)` can be used to *trim* (i.e. discard) unused blocks on solid-state storage. The discard potentially has some benefits as it may prolong SSD lifespan and increases performance on disks that are almost full. Only SSDs should be trimmed.
#### EXT2, EXT3, EXT4 filesystem setting
> The EXT2-4 family of filesystems has been a staple in the Linux kernel for decades. Its most recent member, EXT4, is still very prevalent in desktop Linux users who usually like the fact that it made specifically for their kernels. EXT4 is stable, reliable, and well supported, although its lack of other modern features like compression, encryption, etc has led me to skip using it on my computers for some years now.

Use `tune2fs(8)` to configure EXT2, EXT3, and EXT4 filesystems. For example, `# tune2fs -O "^has_journal" /dev/mapper/crypt-home` will disable journaling on a EXT4 filesystem residing on block device `/dev/mapper/crypt-home`.
#### ZFS
> ZFS is the *last word* in filesystems. It was originally developed by Sun (Oracle), and is one of the most incredible filesystem in many ways. It can do **Copy-on-Write**, **snapshots**, **compression**, **encryption**, **volume management (i.e. software RAID)**, and many other amazing things to ensure your data is safe.

Due to its incompatible license, ZFS was not included in the Linux kernel. Instead, a separate ZFS Linux kernel module is usually used to provide ZFS on Linux computers.

#### Using zfs(8) and zpool(8).
Use `zfs set` and `zpool set` to configure ZFS storage. Also, see [this cheat sheet](/cheat/zfs/).

### Btrfs
> Btrfs is yet another featureful filesystem, featuring **Copy-on-Write (CoW)**, **snapshots**, **compression**, **volume management**, and many other features. Btfs currently has no encryption support, but we can always use Linux `dm-crypt` to enable encryption on block storage.

See this [blog post for Btrfs](/blog/2021/btrfs/)

### fstab(5)
In simplest terms, `fstab(5)` is a text file containing each *entry* of filesystem mounts in a line. Each line has 7 fields, and all 7 fields must be specified otherwise the mount fails. [Here is what I think is a good guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Fstab) to (Arch) Linux `fstab`. I always recommend using UUID for [persistent block device naming](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Persistent_block_device_naming).

> For partitions that are not required to boot, adding `nofail` and `noauto` in the mount options is sometimes recommended to avoid boot failure if such partitions are not available at boot time.

### Basic SQL
Below is an SQL snippet for beginners

    DROP TABLE orders;
	DROP TABLE products;
	DROP TABLE customers;

	CREATE TABLE customers (
	  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
	  lname VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
	  fname VARCHAR(255),
	  city VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT "bkk",
	  CONSTRAINT id_lname_unique UNIQUE(id, lname),
	  PRIMARY KEY (id)
	);

	CREATE TABLE products (
	  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
	  pname VARCHAR(255),
	  price INT NOT NULL,
	  PRIMARY KEY (id)
	);

	CREATE TABLE orders (
	  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
	  cust_id INT,
	  prod_id INT,
	  PRIMARY KEY (id),
	  FOREIGN KEY (cust_id) REFERENCES customers(id),
	  FOREIGN KEY (prod_id) REFERENCES products(id)
	);

	INSERT INTO customers (id, fname, lname, city) VALUES (1, "Artnoi", "Phan", "bkk");
	INSERT INTO customers (id, fname, lname) VALUES (2, "Prem", "Phan");
	INSERT INTO customers (fname, lname) VALUES ("Palita", "Phan");
	INSERT INTO products (pname, price) VALUES ("ThinkPad", 30000);
	INSERT INTO products (pname, price) VALUES ("ThinkCentre", 20000);
	INSERT INTO products (pname, price) VALUES ("ThinkStaion", 40000);
	INSERT INTO orders (id, cust_id, prod_id) VALUES (1, 1, 1);
	INSERT INTO orders (cust_id, prod_id) VALUES (1, 2);
	INSERT INTO orders (cust_id, prod_id) VALUES (1, 3);
	INSERT INTO orders (cust_id, prod_id) VALUES (2, 2);

	# Most expensive product
	SELECT P.pname FROM products P where P.price = (SELECT max(price) FROM products);

	# All customers who have ordered something
	SELECT O.id AS order_id, C.id, fname, P.pname, P.price FROM customers C RIGHT JOIN orders O on C.id = O.cust_id LEFT JOIN products P ON O.prod_id = P.id;

	# All customers who have bought ALL 3 products
	SELECT C.id AS Cust_ID, C.fname AS Cust_name, sum(P.price) AS Total FROM customers C, products P
	WHERE C.id IN
	(SELECT DISTINCT C.id FROM customers C RIGHT JOIN orders O on C.id = O.cust_id LEFT JOIN products P ON O.prod_id = P.id WHERE P.id = 1)
	AND C.id IN
	(SELECT DISTINCT C.id FROM customers C RIGHT JOIN orders O on C.id = O.cust_id LEFT JOIN products P ON O.prod_id = P.id WHERE P.id = 2)
	AND C.id IN
	(SELECT DISTINCT C.id FROM customers C RIGHT JOIN orders O on C.id = O.cust_id LEFT JOIN products P ON O.prod_id = P.id WHERE P.id = 3);
