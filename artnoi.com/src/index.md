# Henlo, vvorld!

Hi, I'm Prem Phansuriyanon, and I'm running this website.

I'm a self-taught back-end software engineer based in Bangkok.

Here's my quick intro:

- a back-end dev by trade

- really passionate about re-inventing the wheel

- use what I write

- love to share my shitty code projects to the world

See my embarassing code on [my GitHub](https://github.com/soyart),
and my notes on [notes.artnoi.com](https://notes.artnoi.com/#/all-pages).

Or you can read my unpopular opinions on [my Twitter](https://twitter.com/artnoi).
