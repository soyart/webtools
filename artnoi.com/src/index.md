# Henlo, vvorld!

Hi, I'm Prem Phansuriyanon, and I'm running this website.

I'm a self-taught back-end software engineer based in Bangkok.

Here's my quick intro:

- a back-end dev by trade

- really passionate about re-inventing the wheel

- use what I write

- love to share my shitty code projects to the world

See my embarassing code on [my GitHub](https://github.com/soyart).

Or you read my unpopular opinions on [my Twitter](https://twitter.com/artnoi).

## About this webs(h)ite

This is where I write my blog and host some public cheat sheets.

I'm not a front-end web dev, so no, this static site does not take 5 seconds
to load, nor does it eat half of your RAM.

The website is divided into 4 locations: [/blog](/blog/) blog,
[/cheat](/cheat) geek cheat sheet, [/noob](/noob/) noob cheat sheet.

## FOSS <3

I'm a huge advocate of [free and open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software).

The entire website is built and deployed using [webtools](https://github.com/soyart/webtools),
a repository of simple shell scripts and GitHub Actions workflows to build and deploy
HTML websites from Markdown files.

All pages on artnoi.com are simple HTML documents with one single separate style
cheat with no external resources, and no cookies are collected. No JavaScript code
is used on this website.

## Credits

The website partially uses monospaced [TTF Hack](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/),
which is my desktop and terminal font face, with blue-ish color scheme from [Iceberg](https://github.com/cocopon/iceberg.vim).

<s>artnoi.com is [served using OpenBSD `httpd(8)` and `relayd(8)`](/blog/2022/openbsd-webserver).</s>

As of Nov 2023, artnoi.com is served using [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages), and built using [webtools](https://github.com/soyart/webtools).
webtools internally uses [ssg](https://rgz.ee/bin/ssg).
