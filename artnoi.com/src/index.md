# Henlo, vvorld!

Hi, I'm [@artnoi](https://twitter.com/artnoi) (Prem), and I'm running this website.

I'm a self-taught back-end software engineer based in Bangkok.
Now I'm working as a back-end engineer for a Thai Web3 startup.

## About this webs(h)ite

I'm not a front-end web dev, so no, this static site does not take 5 seconds
to load, nor does it eat half of your RAM.

The website is divided into 4 locations: [/blog](/blog/) blog,
[/cheat](/cheat) geek cheat sheet, [/noob](/noob/) noob cheat sheet.

## FOSS <3

I'm a huge advocate of [free and open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software).

The software used to produce and serve this website is 100% free and open source!
(at least, the one I actually use, not including the drivers or Vultr VM code).

I appreciate **good code**, so yeah, the webservers are [OpenBSD](https://openbsd.org)!
(with some parts running on Arch Linux).

All pages on artnoi.com are simple HTML documents with one single separate style
cheat with no external resources, and no cookies are collected. No JavaScript code
is used on this website.

## Credits

The website partially uses monospaced [TTF Hack](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/),
which is my desktop and terminal font face, with blue-ish color scheme from [Iceberg](https://github.com/cocopon/iceberg.vim).

I write my web pages in Markdown and then use [webtools](https://github.com/soyart/webtools)
to generate and manage the HTML files.

artnoi.com is [served using OpenBSD `httpd(8)` and `relayd(8)`](/blog/2022/openbsd-webserver).
