# Henlo, vvorld!
Hi, I'm [@artnoi](https://twitter.com/artnoi) (Prem), and I'm running this website.

I'm a self-taught back-end software engineer based in Bangkok. Now I'm working as a back-end engineer for a Thai Web3 startup.

## About this webs(h)ite
I'm not a front-end web dev, so no, this static site does not take 5 seconds to load, nor does it eat half of your RAM.

The website is divided into 4 locations: [/blog](/blog/) blog, [/cheat](/cheat) geek cheat sheet, [/noob](/noob/) noob cheat sheet.

## A+ Security
artnoi.com scores **A+** on [Mozilla Observatory](https://observatory.mozilla.org/analyze/artnoi.com), and [SecurityHeaders.com](https://securityheaders.com). The software used to produce and serve this website is 100% open source! (at least, the one I actually use, not including the drivers or virtualization stuff from Vultr)

I appreciate **good code**, so yeah, the webservers are [OpenBSD](https://openbsd.org)! (with some parts running on Arch Linux).

All pages on artnoi.com are simple HTML documents with one single separate style cheat with no external resources, and no cookies are collected.

## Credits
The website partially uses monospaced [TTF Hack](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/), which is my desktop and terminal font face, with blue-ish color scheme from [Iceberg](https://github.com/cocopon/iceberg.vim).

I wrote my web pages in Markdown and then use [ssg](https://www.romanzolotarev.com/ssg.html) to generate the HTML files.

artnoi.com is [served using OpenBSD `httpd(8)` and `relayd(8)`](/blog/2022/openbsd-webserver).
