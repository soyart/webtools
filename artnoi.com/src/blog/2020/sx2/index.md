# Don't buy Panasonic Toughbook *Let's Note* CF-SX2
## Hardware and construction
Even if you don't open the laptop, it's not hard to notice that this is a really well-made machine overall. The case feels solid, lightweight, and is better finished than my [ThinkPad X230](/blog/2019/thinkpad/). The machine is easily serviceable - all I see are standard Philips screws, although apparently custom-made. A non-techinal person can surely open the case to access the internals. I dislike a few things about the platform - namely the unsercured drive bay (the 2.5-inch drive is held in place by friction), small keyboad size with weird non-character key layout, and the fact that it does not feature a *proper* power button.
## Support from Panasonic
Panasonic sucks compared to Lenovo when it comes to software/hardware support. The parts are hard to obtain (compared to Think products), maybe due to the fact that the laptop is **made in Japan**. Software support is even worse - Panasonic expects you to use Windows when it comes to upgrading the system embedded controller firmware on this model.  

The machine came out in 2012-2013, and the latest BIOS update available from Panasonic was from 2018. [The latest BIOS update](https://na.panasonic.com/us/support/toughbook-support-center#) *depends* on the [earlier battery monitoring firmware](https://na.panasonic.com/us/support/mandatory-safety-bulletin-cf-c2-cf-sx) released by Panasonic back in Windows 7-8 days. Therefore, the update procedure requires you to use Windows (specifically 7-8 for the shitty battery monitor utility) to execute the update program - which I really hate to do. I had to buy a key for the Windows 10 Pro so that I could install the update, only to find out that the latest build of Windows 10 Pro cannot do the battery monitoring firmware stuff - which mean that currently I lack the access to the latest BIOS update. Also, as per my BIOS setting page, the machine seems to only support legacy boot.
## Bottom-line
**Don't buy it**. If you want a Toughbook, just get the semi-rugged or fully-rugged one, or the newer Let's Note, because I don't see any useful value in this old SX2 Toughbook. But I bought it nonetheless (lol, how can you resist a $100 MIJ/JDM laptop?)
