# What is Free Software and Why You Should Care

## Intro to free software

### Free software is user's freedom respecting software.

When you use a computer, there are two components that do the computation for you, the hardware, which physically (electrically) executes instructions with its semi-conductor logic gates, and the software which gives instructions to the hardware to do the computation. **Thus, software itself IS the instruction. It is what tells your computer what to do**. When programmers write a program, they write it in a programming language, **and the work is called the source code**.

### Source code

Source code is human-readable, and so can be read, understood, and studied by human-beings. Computers however do not understand such human-readable source code. Instead, their semi-conductor logic gates in the CPUs only understand zeros and ones (also called binaries), which correspond to ON and OFF charge states in the semi-conductor chips. Hence, in order to run a program on a computer, the source code must be 'compiled' into zeroes and ones called binary executables, which are near-impossible for mortal humans to understand.

### Proprietary software

Today, software is often distribured in binary forms, and thus most software users never see the source code, aka the actual instructions. For example, software companies develop their software in source code, but sell it in binary forms, negating any potentials of the source code being read or studied by its competitors, and even the users. Copyright license is then placed on such complied bianary software, rejecting user's rights to modify the program as they wish. This is like when a car manufacturer tells you that you cannot replace your own oil, or brakes, and cannot have a look at the schematics.

Such software which are released to users only in binary form **with restrictive licenses is called proprietary software**. However, since a program _is_ part of a computer system, using it without knowing the source code is like giving the developers the power to control your computers without you knowing what they will actually do. This is why proprietary programs are not desirable. And most consumer software is proprietary.

### It's about freedom.

Free software, as defined by FSF, is software that respects user's freedom. Usually **it is the freedom to use, share, modify, and study the source code without legal constraints that may harm user's freedom** as in the case of proprietary software. Free software allows people to know what computation their computers are doing, without having to guess whether or not the computers are actually running malicious code. Because free software does not restrict its user from sharing, in reality, most proprietary software packages are built using free software.

**Without free software, there would be no trust in computing**, and our computers would have been more like mere programmable calculators. Even Microsoft now admits they love free software. In this article I am going to call free software FOSS (free and open source software). _I'm sorry, Mr.Stallman._

## Free software is challenging to use, but offers endless possibilities

Anybody who switched from Windows/macOS to Linux should have already noticed how everything is a bit more difficult to _new_ users. Yes, I agree that free software is more difficult to use the first time you are presented with the software, i.e. free software is not as _well-polished_.

I at first also had that thought, but once I took my time to understand it, and realized that most free software is actually much more simple to understand and debug. Over time, I have come to embrace software simplicity over user-friendliness that actually causes more complexity. And I have good reasons for that.

Because using these software everyday for everything requires me to learn more about my hardware and my own systems, I have grown closer and closer to my systems over the years, which I consider is a great and unique experience.

The more I learned, the more I wanted to build my own systems the way I want. I became opinionated, and began to look away from pre-built and pre-configured systems like Ubuntu, Red Hat, etc.

I began using minimal operating systems to use as my base (starting with FreeBSD in 2019), so that I can build up from there by myself, to ensure that my system is indeed _mine_.

This habit of configuring everything up manually eventually paid back very well, as now I understand almost every part of my operating systems - how each subsystem is configured and designed.

## Free software is of higher quality

Although less polished compared to commercial proprierary software, free software is usually of higher quality and more reliable in general. This is because the code is open, and thus most bugs are fixed and new code is rigorously peer-reviewed before being merged into production or master branch.

I always find bugs and _soft errors_ when using commecial proprietary software. **But when it comes to free software, the errors are, most of the times, user errors**.

The fewer number of bugs may be attributed to the fact that free software is small, minimal, and unpolished, there are less unneccessary code that _only_ exists to help the non-technical human users.

That's it guys, be _free_!
