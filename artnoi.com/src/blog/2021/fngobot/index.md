# fngobot - a simple stock tracking Telegram bot written in Go

I have recently working on a new personal project - [@FnGoBot](https://github.com/soyart/fngobot),
which is a Go-based (with a lil bit of Python) Telegram bot for tracking stock prices.

This has always been a project I wanted to do from the time when I was working in a brokerage.

The bot uses a 100% Go-based Telegram framework `telebot`, which is super easy to work with.

# Features

- Quote stock prices

- Track stock prices

- Track and alert stock prices after some conditions are met
