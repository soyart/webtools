# Why Lenovo > Apple
## An accident
Last week, I splilled some drink on my [ThinkPad T14](/blog/2020/t14/). This would cause me a panic if I were using a MacBook Pro - but because my laptop is spill-proof, I just casually powered off the machine and rinsed the machine off with tap water.

Then I opened the machine with just one screwdriver and a hard card, and was very surprised that the entire internals of the machine was dry. Yes, no liquid was found after I spilled a full glass of tea into it.

## I broke my own keyboard
Now that I was assured, I began using the machine as I would normally do. After some days, I noticed my left Shift key was becoming sticky, so I tried to remove the key cap to have it well cleaned - but then I fucked up.

The metal spring or whatever holding that left Shift key cap broke, *but it was still functioning*. Yes, it still worked fine. Yes, the ThinkPad keyboard was just that well-built and engineered.

However, the typing experience became very bad after I broke the key, so I called Lenovo Premiere Support. They came to my house the next business day after I call them.

## Premiere Support - a real deal here
They agreed to change my entire keyboard, without any questions as to why it broke, or if I was openning it up without an authorized technician.

In short, Lenovo agreed to change my entire keyboard free of charge after I myself broke it, and even when the key was still functioning. They simply changed it because the typing experience got worse.

## Lenovo > Apple
If this was some Apple laptop, like the 2016 and 2018 MacBook Pros that I used to own, the support wouldn't do a thing even if some keys were seriously not functioning due to Apple's own flawed design of their butterfly keyboard.

I once got debris sticking under my Mac keys, and the stupid Apple Genius refused to do anything to it, despite it was clear that the keys wouldn't register everytime I hit on the problematic keys.

Fuck Apple, and their engineering team. Sure, the M1 chip performs great, but there is something more to a 'professional' laptop than just powerful, efficient chip.

Their keyboards were not water-proof, not even dust-proof, and if the water got into the keyboard, it would have gone straight to the mobo.

And worse, that ingress would void all the warranty on that computer. Apple will always take liquid damage seriously, but Lenovo didn't even bother to ask.
