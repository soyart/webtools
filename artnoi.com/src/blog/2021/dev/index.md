# My new software development job

I recently got a new job, actually a dream job. Now I work as backend engineer for [Cleverse](https://cleverse.com). Kudos for them to take the risk. (Actually, I thank them for seeing something in me.)

## What I love about this job

It's the people. They are very supportive, cheerful, and understanding. My work hours are also flexible - I get to choose when to work, night or day. But I still have to attend the the stand-up meeting every work day at 11. This meeting is usually 15-20 mins. After the meeting, I usually go to bed to get more rest and start work by the late afternoon.

## Examples of my tasks

My job is not exactly like those of traditional backend developers, as my work also requires me to work with blockchains and smart contracts.

### A simple HTTP server

My first task was to write an HTTP server for users (product administrators, in this case). The simple server simply reads and writes to and from our Postgres database.

### A smart contract event log crawler

My second task is quite challenging to me, since I have only learned programming for 10 months. The task was to read smart contract event logs for specific event types, and mine more data by following the outputs of the event to other smart contracts, and finally save the mined data to Redis. I did not manually (in the code) write to Redis - a colleague wrote a wrapper for Redis which has all the neccessary structs and methods declared.

## Looking forward

I feel good that I have finally got my dream job. But I think I still have to improve a lot more to be worthy of it, to life the probation. I will need to figure out within this 1-2 years if I want to study more into computer science. But for now, my short-term goal is to learn at least one more thing everyday.
