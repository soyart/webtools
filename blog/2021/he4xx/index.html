The reasons I don&rsquo;t use it with music is simply because it&rsquo;s not really transparent, which sucks because I like music with transparent headphones, especially my Etymotic ER4SR.</p><p>HE4XX really shines with movies - planar magnatic bass response and spikes in the high frequency range makes watching action films really enjoyable. Speech is also very clear, and the &ldquo;soundstage&rdquo; is just right.</p><p>Subjectively, HE4XX masks poor quality audio better, which makes it good for movies audio which is not always very well recorded and mastered.</p><p>HD4XX is also quite comfortable to wear throughout the movie sessions. Only recently has I found its true potential as a movie headphones, before that they just sat unused. I now use it regularly for watching anime or movies. Now I wonder if my K7XX is the same (I don&rsquo;t really like K7XX with music so I gave it away to my counsin).</p><p>So if you want a pair of comfortable headphones for movies, just give HE4XX a try. Note that I use my headphones with a desktop amplifier - if you don&rsquo;t own one, you may not be able to crank the volume up wekk enough (without distortion) and your experience may differ with mine.</p><h2 id=compared-to-my-sennheiser-hd600>Compared to my Sennheiser HD600</h2><p>I enjoy music better with HD600, but when it comes to movies, I like HE4XX more, simply because the sound makes movies much more enjoyable. Maybe it is because HD600 is a lil bit too &ldquo;in your face&rdquo; sounding, and the &ldquo;soundstage&rdquo; is not very impressive for movies.</p><hr><p><a href=#top>Back to top</a></p><hr><footer><p>Copyright (c) 2019 Prem Phansuriyanon</p><p>Verbatim copying and redistribution of this entire page are permitted provided this notice is preserved</p></footer></body></html>
