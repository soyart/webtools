However, using only <code>httpd(8)</code> to serve this website also has one downside - <em>downtime</em>, which is quite annoying when you have to do some maintenance tasks.</p><p>I thought about adding another webserver, but then I realized if I was going to make my web stack more complex than needed, why <em>not</em> build a load-balancer or reverse proxies too this time, so that I don&rsquo;t have to worry about downtime when one of the webservers is taken down.</p><p>The addition of <a href=/searx>searx.artnoi.com (artnoi.com/searx)</a> neccessitates the need for a result proxy <code>filtron</code> and image proxy <code>morty</code>, which is exactly what NGINX is typically used as reverse proxies for.</p><blockquote><p><a href=https://searx.github.io/searx/admin/installation-nginx.html#nginx-searx-site>Searx documentation about <code>filtron</code> and <code>morty</code></a></p></blockquote><h2 id=overview>Overview</h2><p>The diagram of what I had in mind looks something like this:</p><pre><code># Redirect to HTTPS
HTTPS clients: http://artnoi.com
&gt; HTTPS proxy	:80 HTTP 301 https://artnoi.com

# Relays and reverse proxies
HTTPS clients: https://artnoi.com
&gt; HTTPS proxy	:443
&gt; Load balancer :8082
&gt; Webservers	:8080 HTTP 200 OK
</code></pre><p>Non-Searx part can be configured with the design above very easily, and one OpenBSD machine can do this. I knew OpenBSD ships with its own <code>relayd(8)</code>, but that would mean my entire webstack would rely solely on OpenBSD utilities (which is a good thing).</p><p><em>But</em> I cannot do the Searx part on OpenBSD unless I installed Python and other crazy $h!t packages on my OpenBSD to run Searx.</p><p>Because I want to not install any extra software at all on OpenBSD, and the fact that I may be even too noob to patch this to run on OpenBSD, <em>I will do the Searx part on Arch Linux</em>.</p><p>OpenBSD will be the main webserver, and <code>relayd(8)</code> will also be used <strong>to make it seem more complicated than it should be</strong>, because why not? The web is bloat, bruh!</p><h2 id=openbsd-relayd-8>OpenBSD relayd(8)</h2><p><a href=https://openbsd.org>OpenBSD</a> ships with <code>relayd(8)</code>, a simple relay daemon that can dynamically redirect incoming connections to target hosts. It can be configured with <code>relayd.conf(5)</code> pretty easily, and the manual page contains many useful examples for relaying and redirecting different connections.</p><p>But when I tried <code>relayd(8)</code>, although it could do the relays and redirections just fine, I had some minor problems with TLS, and this escalated further when I tried adding new webservers (e.g. the one doing <a href=/searx>searx.artnoi.com</a> on different hosts to the relays.</p><p>Obtaining a certificate was a headache, and more so when serving it, e.g. renaming or linking the certificate to the actual IP address of the interface is tiring.</p><p>So I had to find something else, but could not found anything satisfying except for NGINX</p><blockquote><p>TL;DR - For now, <code>relayd</code> is not used as HTTPS proxy, but HTTP and other TCP/UDP connections (e.g. <a href=/blog/2020/endlessh/>SSH</a>).</p></blockquote><h2 id=nginx-https-nginx-com><a href=https://nginx.com>NGINX</a></h2><p>OpenBSD also provides binary package for <a href=https://nginx.com>NGINX</a>, a widely-used webserver and proxy software. NGINX has advantages in that it is cross-platform and thus configuration can be copied over from one system to another without much efforts.</p><p>So I use my Arch Linux VPS (let&rsquo;s call it host 0) as NGINX HTTPS proxy, since I don&rsquo;t want to install extra packages on my OpenBSD VPS (let&rsquo;s call it host 1). So now, the diagram looks something like this</p><blockquote><p>Domain artnoi.com resolves to Host 0&rsquo;s public IP address</p></blockquote><pre><code>HTTPS client: https://artnoi.com
&gt; NGINX HTTPS proxy	(Host0):443
&gt; relayd proxy		(Host1):8082
&gt; Webservers  (Host1,Host2):8080 HTTP 200 OK

HTTPS client: https://artnoi.com/searx
&gt; NGINX HTTPS proxy (Host 0):443
&gt; filtron 			(Host 0):4004
&gt; Searx instance	(Host 0):8888 HTTP 200 OK
</code></pre><p>Many ACME client software has support for NGINX, so I can quickly obtained certficates using any means comfortable to me.</p><h3 id=nginx-obtaining-let-s-encrypt-certificate-with-certbot>NGINX - obtaining Let&rsquo;s Encrypt certificate with certbot</h3><p>I used bloated <code>certbot</code> as ACME client. And I configured a <code>webroot</code> for ACME, and use NGINX as HTTPS frontend on my NGINX configuration. I chose to have one certificate for all of my domains.</p><p>The result is one server block that would establish HTTPS connections for all of my domains - artnoi.com, www.artnoi.com, artnoi.com/cheat, noob.artnoi.com, searx.artnoi.com, artnoi.xyz, searx.artnoi.xyz.</p><p>You can write a dummy configuration just for ACME challenges, or use webroot method to avoid downtime. I write a separate ACME webroot configuration for NGINX which will later be included by production configuration:</p><pre><code># /etc/nginx/production/letsencrypt/webroot

# webroot is /var/lib/letsencrypt
location ^~ /.well-known/acme-challenge/ {
  allow all;
  root /var/lib/letsencrypt/;
  default_type &quot;text/plain&quot;;
  try_files $uri =404;
}
</code></pre><p>Also, make sure that <code>/var/lib/letsencrypt</code> is ready as webroot:</p><pre><code class=language-shell>WEBROOT='/var/lib/letsencrypt';

mkdir -p &quot;${WEBROOT}/.well-known&quot;;
chgrp http &quot;$WEBROOT&quot;;
chmod g+s &quot;$WEBROOT&quot;;
</code></pre><h3 id=nginx-as-https-reverse-proxies>NGINX as HTTPS reverse proxies</h3><p>After NGINX reverse proxy establishes HTTPS connections with the certificates, it then proxies the HTTP connection <em>in plain text</em> but under WireGuard VPN to <code>relayd(8)</code> on port 8082, whose load-balancing configuration is much simpler.</p><p>My website is static HTML pages, which is served mainly by OpenBSD httpd(8), and a backup Arch Linux webserver at home. But there&rsquo;s also Searx instance running on <a href=/searx>/searx</a>, which needs <code>filtron</code> and <code>morty</code> for search sanitation. The Searx instance, <code>filtron</code>, and <code>morty</code>, all three are on the same Linux host.</p><p>My final configuration has 2 server blocks, one listening on 80 for HTTP requests and ACME challenges, and the other on port 443 for HTTPS.</p><p>I wrote a separate file for serving HTTPS, and it will be included by the server block listening on port 443:</p><pre><code class=language-shell>ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/artnoi.com/fullchain.pem;
ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/artnoi.com/privkey.pem;
include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf;
ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem;
</code></pre><p>And this is my 2 <code>server</code> blocks:</p><pre><code>server {

</code></pre><h3 id=relayd-8-as-load-balancer>relayd(8) as load-balancer</h3><p>First, let&rsquo;s define our relay protocols. Both NGINX and relayd can do TCP relays (<code>stream</code> in NGINX configuration), but here we will be using plain-text HTTP as intended. I wrote my <code>httpfilter</code> protocol (relay rules) in a separate file <code>/etc/relayd.httpfilter.conf</code>:</p><blockquote><p>Don&rsquo;t just copy and paste. The HTTP <a href=https://securityheaders.com>security headers</a> can break your website if not done properly.</p></blockquote><pre><code>http protocol &quot;httpfilter&quot; {
