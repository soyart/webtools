On Mac, I need external expensive program &lsquo;BitPerfect&rsquo; to do the bit-perfect output to USB DACs.</p><p>On <strong>Arch Linux</strong> however, everything is super easy - you just install <code>pulseaudio-alsa</code> and boom, you get the DAC working at the right sample rate.</p><p>This means that when I watch Blu-ray videos 48KHz audio, the dac operates at 48KHz, and when I&rsquo;m listening 44.1KHz music, the DAC operates at 44.1KHz.</p><p>And it does all this without a single failure - much better than the paid BitPerfect for Mac.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t buy into High-res audio, so I haven&rsquo;t tested it yet, but I think it should act the same way.</p><p>If you have multiple DACs, you may want to install <code>pvaucontrol</code> so that you can graphically switch the audio sinks without having to learn the command-line.</p><hr><p><a href=#top>Back to top</a></p><hr><footer><p>Copyright (c) 2019 Prem Phansuriyanon</p><p>Verbatim copying and redistribution of this entire page are permitted provided this notice is preserved</p></footer></body></html>
