my current responsibilities have been limiting
my free time for maintaining the website.</p><p>While I&rsquo;ve setup an old-school CI/CD pipelines
using shell scripts on my OpenBSD box to sync
website files from Git repo periodically,
I&rsquo;m tired of worrying about security.</p><h2 id=but-you-said-openbsd-was-cool>But you said OpenBSD was cool</h2><p>The only reason I chose OpenBSD as previous webserver
was because of security concerns. If I, a normal person,
have to host a public website on the internet,
I&rsquo;d rather prefer the most secure OS by defaults
as my webserver box.</p><p>But lately, I&rsquo;ve been thinking, if I could
delegate this public-facing component with someone else&rsquo;s,
then I wouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about it being hacked!</p><h2 id=how>How</h2><p>I just simply added a GitHub Actions file in <a href=https://github.com/soyart/webtools>webtools</a>,
and this will build and deploy my websites to GitHub Pages
with my custom domain name.</p><p>I push the new articles markdowns and the website
gets updated like before, but without the risks of having my
personal servers attacked.</p><p>Laziness wins I guess.</p><hr><p><a href=#top>Back to top</a></p><hr><footer><p>Copyright (c) 2019 Prem Phansuriyanon</p><p>Verbatim copying and redistribution of this entire page are permitted provided this notice is preserved</p></footer></body></html>
